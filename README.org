Make emacsclient the default editor of MacOS.

The ideas are got from here: https://east.fm/posts/open-with-emacsclient/index.html, just to make it more convenient.

* Use
This may take several seconds:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  . ./setup.sh
#+END_SRC

* How (If you want to make it yourself)
1. Make a file /usr/local/bin/emacsclient and save the following code in it (May need "chmod +x").
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     #!/bin/zsh
     # Start emacsclient and return immediately.

     /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -n -c "$@"
   #+END_SRC

2. Make a desktop app with [[https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus][Platypus]] , use the following settings (according to your own need):
   1. Interface must not be "None" (I don't know why), so "Progress Bar" is the one.

   2. Check the "Accepts dropped items" and click the "Settings" button, then check as below:

3. Make it can open the files same with Emacs self, use this [[file:./copyDocTypes.py][script]]; Then copy it to /Applications.
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     python copyDocTypes.py
   #+END_SRC

4. Use the following command to apply the system config:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  "/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister" -lint -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
#+END_SRC
